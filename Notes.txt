Why TCGA-LUAD Data Matters Here

Your project (LUAD_CT_SURVIVAL_segmen) is modeling lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) survival using CT imaging + radiomic features — so we need:

Image features (which you already have in LUAD_multimodal_dataset_with_paths.csv), and

True clinical survival outcomes (time-to-event and status) to evaluate model performance scientifically.

That second part — how long each patient lived after diagnosis and whether they died or not — comes from TCGA-LUAD clinical data, provided by the NIH’s Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
